The real estate industry has not been busy at all. People are not having Open Houses, selling homes or moving during this pandemic, so I do not have any work. I only have 1 client left and she is very slow. 
2. It's the same as it has been, no major changes, with the exception of having the kids home from school. 
3. All of my kids have been home since March. I was lucky to be a parent that was used to working from home so I could be with my children, to help them with home  schooling and not worry about it affecting my job or my schedule.

My partner struggles with ADHD and Paranoid Personality Disorder. He is good man, he's a good provider, and can be very charming, but most of the time he isolates, becomes very distant, cold, emotionless, & difficult to communicate with, he's got very high walls, and is highly defensive. He accuses me of doing things that I am not doing, he's very hard on the kids, and although he says he loves us, he definitely does not show us that. No attention, no affection, only rules and high expectations. It's difficult. I've thought of leaving many times, but I do not earn enough money to support the children on my own.

Managing home life and work at first it was somewhat stressful, since as I was not used to it I felt out of place, but little by little with the help, collaboration and understanding of my wife, who helped me a lot, I have been able to find a perfect balance between the two.

I am now working exclusively from home full-time. I was working full-time in-person before the pandemic. The shift has been a struggle. There are many more distractions from home. I cannot seem to turn off from work because I feel guilty I have not given my full attention to work activities during the day.
2. It is difficult to manage work and home life. The two have blended together such that my attention to either is never 100%. It causes some difficulty with my wife because I might say I will do something around the house, but then forget or get distracted by an impromptu work call.
3. The absence of formal schooling for my kids is difficult. My wife and I have to address their schooling needs during the day and sometimes even facilitate instruction. My wife and I both find this to be somewhat challenging because we do not really know how and when to hold our kids accountable for their work/progress.
4. My wife has been working from home, but with fewer hours. She's having to work a more variable schedule, which means our eating schedule is more inconsistent.

We baked bread, cookies, made dinners; things i never had time to do over the years as a more than full time working mom.    Sometimes she got sick of me, but we got along majority of the time.... & she liked that i did her laundry.

When we went back, in May, there was another critical project and those that wanted to come in were paid double. The whole taking temperatures and asking if I've been socially distancing myself I feel is an invasion of privacy. 

The shift has been difficult as my husband is now going to be working remote forever. His work is eliminating 6 of 7 floors they rent. This negates the entire reason we moved to Chicago. He WANTED to work downtown, and now he CAN'T. 

Managing home and work life has been horrible. With the last minute homeschooling it's been a nightmare. the 3rd grader wasnt too bad, but the kindergartener was very difficult. I did not go to college to be a teacher and there is a reason why. I do not have the patience.

When it was only supposed to be a couple weeks, it was tolerable. But the governor of our state is a giant asshat that is a dictatorial tyrant and ordering people to wear masks in their own homes. Our mayor has destroyed the economy of Chicago. 52% of restaurants and bars will never reopen. Then the riots on top of the covid has exacerbated the situation.

Because of how the schooling was done, the kids were really not learning as well as if they were attending inperson classes. My oldest son started showing signs of depression because there was no interaction with his classmates. 

My husband works more hours now if I don't remind him to step away from the computer for the day.

Me being home has had a lot of advantages in being there for our children and pets but it's been difficult because I do all of the housework now and no one seems to want to help. ,,Disagree2,Agree6,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Somewhat Disagree3,Disagree2,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Extremely Satisfied5,Somewhat Satisfied4,Extremely Satisfied5,Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied3,Somewhat Dissatisfied2,Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied3,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied3,,Somewhat Satisfied4,,Somewhat Dissatisfied2,Extremely Satisfied5,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Dissatisfied2,Somewhat true2,Somewhat true2,Not at all true1,Fairly true3,Not at all true1,Fairly true3,Somewhat true2,Not at all true1,Somewhat true2,Somewhat true2,Not at all true1,Somewhat true2,Mildly agree4,Mildly agree4,Strongly agree5,Strongly agree5,Strongly agree5,Strongly agree5,Strongly agree5,Neither agree nor disagree3,Mildly agree4,Strongly agree5,Mildly agree4,Mildly disagree2,Strongly agree5,Very much9,3,Very much9,2,Very much9,Very much9,3,Very much9,Very much9,Very much9,Very much9,7,Very much9,3,6,Not at all1,Very much9,Not at all1,2,8,Not at all1,Not at all1,6,Not at all1,Very much9,It's growing and evolving ,very happy,Mostly or always me(80-100% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),More likely me(60-80% me),More likely my partner(20-40% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Mostly or always my partner(0-20% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Fair to both you and your partner,Somewhat satisfied,Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),,,Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),,Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),Fair to both you and your partner,Somewhat satisfied,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Strongly Agree5,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Strongly Agree5,Strongly Disagree1,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Agree5,Strongly Agree5,Agree4,Strongly Agree5,Disagree2,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Agree4,Strongly Agree5,Somewhat Agree4,Strongly Agree  5,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Strongly Agree  5,Somewhat Agree4,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Strongly Agree  5,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,1,2,7,4,5,9,3,10,6,8,5,1,4,3,2,7,6,10,9,8,Strongly disagree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,Somewhat agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,Strongly disagree,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Agree6,Agree5,Agree5,Strongly Agree6,Disagree2,Strongly Disagree1,Somewhat Agree4,Agree5,Strongly Disagree1,Somewhat Disagree3,Agree5,Somewhat Disagree3,Strongly Disagree1,Somewhat Agree4,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Disagree2,Somewhat Agree4,Extremely Negative,Extremely Negative,Extremely Negative,Extremely Negative,Neither Positive nor Negative,Extremely Negative,Slightly Positive,Neither Positive nor Negative,Extremely Positive,Extremely Positive,Extremely Positive,Moderately Positive,Extremely Positive,Extremely Positive,6046830b-05cf-4b61-b4a8-b35c60df2837,BD87C869-1271-4CFD-91FD-0014BE69CEB3,,,,1,

My pay was slightly impacted in order to attempt to save jobs for the 20-21 school year, we all took a small pay cut to save some funding.

I was also disgusted by how little work she appeared to do around the house while I was performing paid work. I was bothered by her and her unemployed adult son sitting around enjoying themselves while I was trying to be productive.
2. I consider myself lucky to have employment flexibility, managing commitments has been fine. I have adjusted to and accepted all facets of working from home while others are present and not working. It is going Okay now. 
3. Last year went well, this year looks like it will be more difficult. Remote school learning was easy last year, expectations were low and it did not consume very much of my time to administer. This year our child will be going to school on a hybrid schedule and the remote work looks to be much more rigorous with high expectations. I expect it will take much more parental involvement.

Before the pandemic happened I was already in between jobs. But with the pandemic, I find it hard to find a job.

2. How has it been managing home life and work life?

I do not work. I manage the home. And since it is just me and my husband, I think I am doing okay.

3. If you have any school-aged children at home, have changes in available childcare and/or school affected your home and work life?

We do not have children together but he has 2 (15yo and 18yo) but they live with their mother in another state.

We had recently relocated for my job in January 2020.  We were initially in temp housing and just put in an offer on hour house the day before the state (WA) issued it's stay-at-home order.  We closed and were able to move in about 5 weeks later.  I have a dedicated office, and she often worked from the couch (she is not employed, but spends her days taking training and attending seminars that catch her interest, and keeping up with friends and family on WhatApp) on her laptop as coming from a smaller San Francisco apartment we really didn't have a lot of furniture otherwise.  We've since bought a desk and chair and set one of the bedrooms up as her officespace.  I love that we get to have ""watercooler"" moments to see each other throughout the day and rather dread the day that I return to the office and have a 60-90min commute at the beginning and end of the day.  One of the flip sides of WFH that I've noticed is that I can too easily just get so immersed in my work that I can look up and realize it's 8-9pm.

I've gone back in the survey to add this narrative as I notice that you later talk about parenting and I was initially answering based on my current relationship.  
For additional context:
My ex and I divorced Jan 2015 and she remarried April 2015.  We lived in the same town and had 50/50 custody with an alternating week schedule.  Regardless of the week I picked my daughter up from dance and took her home (either my house or ex, depending on week) and coached my son's soccer and track teams; so I had plenty of time with them.  I met my to-be wife Aug 2016 .  We'd date on non-kid weeks and she was super supportive and encouraging of the necessity of my time with them.  Kids were aware of her after a few months, but we didn't formally introduce her to the kids until I think it was July 2017, wanting to first work on Us and making sure there was something there before bringing her into the kids' lives.  I proposed in December 2017; that month I was also laid off from work and looked extensively, but there was ultimately nothing local after looking 6mo so in May I accepted a job in San Francisco and had to move away from the kids.  She and I upped our wedding plans and married in May 2018 and we moved in together in SF as I began my new job in June.  I then travelled back every 3rd weekend to be with the kids Fri Sat Sun.  I was laid off again Oct 2019 and this time moved outside Seattle in Jan 2020.  So much of the context of the parenting questions is framed by the fact that my job took me away from the kids and I have limited ability to be with them, especially since Covid struck.",,Agree6,Strongly Agree7,Strongly Agree7,Somewhat Agree5,Strongly Agree7,Strongly Agree7,Neither Agree nor Disagree4,Somewhat Agree5,Somewhat Agree5,Somewhat Satisfied4,Extremely Satisfied5,Extremely Satisfied5,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,Extremely Satisfied5,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Satisfied4,,Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied3,Somewhat Satisfied4,Somewhat Dissatisfied2,Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied3,Extremely Satisfied5,Somewhat Satisfied4,Fairly true3,Very true4,Very true4,Not at all true1,Very true4,Somewhat true2,Somewhat true2,Not at all true1,Very true4,Somewhat true2,Somewhat true2,Very true4,Mildly agree4,Mildly agree4,Mildly agree4,Neither agree nor disagree3,Mildly agree4,Mildly agree4,Mildly agree4,Strongly disagree1,Mildly agree4,Neither agree nor disagree3,Mildly disagree2,Mildly disagree2,Strongly disagree1,Very much9,2,7,3,Very much9,Very much9,2,8,Very much9,8,8,5,Very much9,3,5,Not at all1,6,Not at all1,7,7,Not at all1,2,6,Not at all1,7,I've really enjoyed the time I get with her throughout the day now.,very happy,More likely my partner(20-40% me),More likely my partner(20-40% me),Shared about equally(40-60% me),Mostly or always my partner(0-20% me),More likely my partner(20-40% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),Mostly or always my partner(0-20% me),Mostly or always my partner(0-20% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),More likely me(60-80% me),Mostly or always me(80-100% me),,More likely my partner(20-40% me),Fair to both you and your partner,Somewhat satisfied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Strongly Agree5,Disagree2,Disagree2,,Disagree2,,Agree4,Strongly Agree5,Strongly Agree5,Agree4,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Agree4,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Disagree1,Strongly Agree5,Agree4,Somewhat Disagree2,Somewhat Agree4,Somewhat Agree4,Somewhat Disagree2,Neither Agree nor Disagree3,Somewhat Disagree2,Somewhat Agree4,Somewhat Agree4,6,1,9,4,8,7,3,5,2,10,4,1,10,7,6,5,2,8,3,9,Somewhat agree,Somewhat disagree,Strongly disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Strongly disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Somewhat agree,Agree5,Agree5,Disagree2,Somewhat Agree4,Somewhat Agree4,Somewhat Disagree3,Somewhat Disagree3,Somewhat Agree4,Strongly Agree6,Somewhat Agree4,Somewhat Agree4,Strongly Agree6,Disagree2,Somewhat Agree4,Disagree2,Disagree2,Agree5,Agree5,Somewhat Agree4,Strongly Agree6,Disagree2,Somewhat Agree4,Moderately Negative,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,Slightly Positive,Slightly Negative,Slightly Positive,Extremely Negative,Slightly Negative,Moderately Negative,Moderately Positive,Slightly Positive,Moderately Positive,Moderately Positive,Slightly Negative,ea612483-f8a3-462e-a349-1970f2ebe7e7,E9876A32-7910-4DC9-9BE1-0002CC62B83D,8ad9fdad-d7a1-11ea-a699-0a56b5a211b2,31891,1,1,
